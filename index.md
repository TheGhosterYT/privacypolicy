# Privacy Policy
>Thanks for using me!

I'm a Discord bot made by D3V1L#9045 and I use the discord API to help interact with servers and members!!
I am used by commands meaning any info I collect is up to the users of me to use the command that does so
If a command takes user data, then the command will show the user that it does to inform them!

## Infomation I collect

I use APIs such as Discord, Youtube, and other APIs that I need to use commands
All commands do not and will not ever take personal info and/or data from users or anyone

The info I collect from users are just their User ID, Name, If they are a bot or not, and Joined at the date on discord
I also collect message count from messages in a server to supply XP for one of the bot systems(Ranking system)

I collect Music info from YT for the Music system to play music or other audio in a VC,
- The music is only played under command the user will have to use meaning no music will autoplay, which the user doesn't want.

## What I do with this data
I will only use this data for the right commands and I will never take data that are personal and can be used harmfully
I am made to protect users and make sure I am used fairly and Friendly

## Can I remove this data?
Yes, by contacting me in the ways below, you can ask me to remove the type of data on you and I will do so, if I don't collect such data I will tell you so
-I will not use any data without consent,
-I will not Keep any data,
-I will not share any data other than, Discord if needed for Law reasons.

## Will the data be shared?
No, the data will not be shared with anyone at all other than if discord needs it for law reason
-However, I do not collect such data where discord will ask for them so All data is private and even I won't see them
